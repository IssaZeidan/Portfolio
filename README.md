# Portfolio
Welcome to my project, a website built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap!

This website is a visual representation of my skills in front-end web development. I utilized the latest version of Bootstrap to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal viewing experience for all users.

In terms of design, I focused on creating a clean and modern interface that is both visually appealing and easy to navigate. I paid attention to every detail, from typography to color schemes, to ensure a cohesive and professional look.

Throughout the development process, I followed best practices in HTML and CSS coding, ensuring that my code is clean, efficient, and easy to maintain.

Overall, this project is a showcase of my abilities in front-end web development, and I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed creating it.
